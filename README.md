## What I Learned

* **Component-based architecture:** Breaking down the UI into reusable, isolated components for better maintainability.
* **Theming with TypeScript:** Strongly typed themes enabled safer, scalable styling.
* **State management:** Advanced use of React Context API and reducers to handle complex state logic cleanly.
* **Form management & validation:** Leveraged React Hook Form to efficiently manage form state, validations, and resets.
* **Lifecycle & effects:** Mastered the useEffect hook to control side effects such as countdown logic and dynamic document titles.
* **Routing & navigation:** Implemented React Router DOM for seamless client-side navigation and route layouts.
* **Performance & UX:** Ensured smooth user experience with controlled vs uncontrolled inputs and prop drilling elimination.
* **Immutability & code quality:** Adopted Immer for immutable updates and configured ESLint for consistent code standards.
* **Persistence:** Implemented localStorage persistence to keep user data intact across sessions.
